###  Notes ###
* Inspired by [**Brackets---Tabs**](https://github.com/crot4lus/Brackets---Tabs) by [**crot4lus**](https://github.com/crot4lus)
* This extension might conflict with other extensions which also modify the working files list like: adding icon
* Layout still not good for split view
* Rearrange tab list not quite good
